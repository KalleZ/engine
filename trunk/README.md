Tuxxedo Engine
==============

Tuxxedo Engine is a component-based PHP5 library that aids in building and
managing large web applications. It contains components for MVC applications,
database connectivity, an ActiveRecord ORM, a query-builder and user
authentication & authorisation management, along with a session manager.

Tuxxedo's still in a fairly early state, things to excuse for now (that will be
fixed later):

* Components will be more decoupled later on.
* Classes will be moved to their own files.
  * With a better directory structure.
  * And an autoloader to make loading them easier.
