	Internationalization
	 - Add support for 'resetable' phrases
	 - Phrases should use ids instead of named groups, which makes validation much easier

	Datamanagers
	 - Session
	  - Cleanup, remove the hacky part and make sure \Tuxxedo\User work

	Bugs
	 - Language
	  - Delete does not remove phrasegroups, may also include phrases too as the code fragment is the same
	 - Template
	  - Saving a template without a source causes it to be converted to NULL
	 - Autoloader on case sensitive systems does not work, Helper, Style Storage, Datamanagers
	 - Look into why converting to UTF-8 on some systems blanks out templates in the template manager
